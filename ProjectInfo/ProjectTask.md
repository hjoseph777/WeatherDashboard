## 🎯 Project Overview

### 📋 Project Summary
The **Weather Dashboard** is an advanced mini-app designed to provide users with comprehensive weather information through an intuitive mobile interface. This cross-platform application demonstrates modern mobile development practices using React Native and Expo CLI.

### 🌟 Project Objectives
- Deliver real-time weather data through seamless API integration
- Provide an engaging user experience with animations and interactive components  
- Implement multi-screen navigation for enhanced functionality
- Demonstrate professional mobile development workflows and collaboration

### 🏗️ **Architecture Decision: `src/` Structure**
**📁 We are using traditional `src/` folder organization with React Navigation instead of Expo Router**

**Why this decision benefits our team:**
- **⚡ Simplicity:** Standard React Native patterns that all team members understand
- **📚 Resources:** Extensive tutorials and documentation available online
- **⏰ Time Efficient:** No additional package installation or learning curve overhead
- **👥 Team Collaboration:** Easier coordination with familiar, industry-standard structure
- **🔧 Already Configured:** React Navigation dependencies are already installed and ready

**vs. Expo Router Alternative:**
- Expo Router requires additional setup (`npx create-expo-app --template tabs`)
- File-based routing adds complexity for team coordination
- Less documentation available for troubleshooting
- Additional learning curve during time-constrained project

**📂 Our Project Structure:**
```
